Hello ! 

This repository is here to put all my drafts of CSS/HTML projects in relation of the thing I learn through The Odin Project courses. 

In here I will try to exercise all the knowledge I have acquired in order to setup a good Index file in HTML, from making the boilerplate by hands to define each paragraph and training on inserting link and images.
